# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cloverleaf Interoperability Standard are documented here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with the pre-1.0 policy that MINOR releases may include breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

## [reference-impl 0.1.1] — 2026-04-17

Bug-fix release addressing issues surfaced by the v0.1.0 end-to-end demo and final code review.

### Fixed

- Auto-create `.cloverleaf/events/` and `.cloverleaf/feedback/` on first write (previously crashed with ENOENT in fresh consumer repos).
- `advanceStatus` is now atomic: the status event is emitted before the task file is saved, so a failed emit leaves the task unchanged. A failed save after a successful emit produces a clear "orphan event" error.
- Every write path now validates against the corresponding `@cloverleaf/standard` schema via the new `lib/validate.ts` (AJV). `saveTask`, `writeFeedback`, `emitStatusTransition`, and `emitGateDecision` throw on invalid input.
- Shared `formatReason` helper eliminates drift between the validator-input `reason` and the persisted `reason` on status-transition events.
- CLI `advance-status` now rejects `actor=system` with exit code 2 (previously silently cast to `agent`). `system` is not a valid actor for task transitions in the Standard's state machine.
- `tests/cli.test.ts` fixtures aligned with the real task + project schemas so they double as teaching examples.

### Changed

- **Branch topology:** state commits now land on `main`; feature branches (`cloverleaf/<task-id>`) carry only code. Skills handle the `git checkout main` transitions. The Reviewer never `git checkout`s — uses `git show` and `git worktree add` instead. See README "Branch topology".

### Added

- `reference-impl/lib/validate.ts` — shared AJV `validateOrThrow` helper loading all `@cloverleaf/standard` schemas once.
- `reference-impl/README.md` gains a "Branch topology" section.

## [reference-impl 0.1.0] — 2026-04-XX

First release of the Cloverleaf reference implementation package.

### Added

- `@cloverleaf/reference-impl@0.1.0` — Tight-Loop reference implementation (Implementer + Reviewer) as Claude Code skills.
- Five skills: `/cloverleaf-new-task`, `/cloverleaf-implement`, `/cloverleaf-review`, `/cloverleaf-merge`, `/cloverleaf-run`.
- `lib/` TypeScript library for state + events + feedback + ID allocation.
- `install.sh` with user-level and project-local modes.
- `examples/toy-repo/` end-to-end demo.
- Targets L2 Exchange conformance of `@cloverleaf/standard@0.3.0`.

### Known gaps

- Documenter, UI Reviewer, QA, Researcher, Plan agents are stubbed (state transitions emitted, no work performed).
- No HTTP endpoints; L3 conformance deferred.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-XX

### Added

- Conformance levels: L1 Producer, L2 Exchange, L3 Host. Every schema, validator, agent contract, state machine, and scenario is assigned to a level via `conformance/level-map.ts`.
- `--level=<1|2|3|all>` flag on the conformance runner (`npm run validate:examples -- --level=2`).
- Per-example `.meta.json` sidecars declaring which level(s) each fixture targets.
- Per-level Vitest suites: `conformance/tests/by-level/l1.test.ts`, `l2.test.ts`, `l3.test.ts`.
- `standard/docs/conformance.md` rewritten around the three-level model.
- `standard/docs/versioning.md` section on levels and SemVer.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/standard.yml` running tests + filtered conformance on Node 20 and 22.
- npm package metadata: `publishConfig`, `files`, `prepublishOnly`, `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `license`, `keywords`.
- Repo-root `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT).

### Changed

- `@cloverleaf/standard` bumped to `0.3.0`.
- `standard/README.md` adds Conformance and Publish sections.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-17
